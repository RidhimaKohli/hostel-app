# Hostel Web App

An app to manage the processes for hostels of IIT Jodhpur.

## Instructions for setup

1. Fork and clone this repository. Press the fork button on the top right of this page. Then on your console type `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hostel-web-app`. Make sure to replace `<your-username>` with your github username.

   **Note**: If on Windows, you can skip steps 3-6 by just executing the "SETUP_ENV.bat" file. After the batch file has been executed, follow step 5 whenever you open a new console for this project.

2. Navigate to the project folder. Enter `cd hostel-web-app` on your console to shift to the current project folder.

3. Setup the virtual environment.
   Use any virtual management tool, either `conda` or the `virtualenv` package. `virtualenv` is preffered for this project. To install `virtualenv` enter
   `pip install virtualenv` on your console.

   For linux/MacOS users, add sudo behind the command
   `sudo pip install virtualenv`

   **Note**: Use `pip3` instead of `pip` if you use pip3 to install packages for your python3 installation.

4. Create a new virtual environment. To create a new environment for this project, type `virtualenv hostel-app` on your console. This will create a virtual environment in python to install all our dependencies.

   You can name your environment whatever you want. However to follow along with the steps and compatibility, the name "hostel-app" is preferred.

5. Activate the environment. To activate the environment, follow the instructions:

   On windows: `/hostel-app/Scripts/activate`

   On Linux/MacOs: `source hostel-app/bin/activate`

   If activation is successful, you will see `(hostel-app)` as a prefix to every prompt in your console.

6. Install dependencies. Installing all the dependencies is quite simple, just type `pip install -r requirements.txt` on your console. It should install all the dependencies automatically for you. Repeat this step whenever a new dependency is added/removed.

   Linux/MacOS might use `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

Whenever you close the current terminal window, activate the virtual environment again by following step 5.
